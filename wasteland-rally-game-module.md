# The End of the World

The world ended in nuclear war that destroyed nearly everything, but you've heard that story before. The end of the world before is just history, a myth of a time that no one really remembers.

These days people get by in small enclaves, heavily fortified camps, scraping by on the meager resources they scavenge from the endless wasteland.

The wasteland is too vast and too dangerous to scavenge on foot, instead the enclaves assemble vehicles from the plentiful wreckage along the old roads and cities. Teams are sent out to pull together whatever they can find. But there are other ways to acquire a little extra...

# The Racing Arena

It's human nature to see a niche and exploit it. That's how we got here in the first place. Against a backdrop of near endless struggle came the racing arenas, and the Wasteland Rally.

Those same teams that scour the wasteland have the opportunity to turn their pitiful hauls into a bounty that will sustain their enclave for months (at just a little personal risk). Competing against other teams in violent races and arena battles, the eventual winner takes all, minus a small fee to the organizer of course.

# Gates

Wasteland Rally uses a type of objective marker called a Gate, which is a line roughly 8-10 inches wide (though you can model more interesting terrain for your gates). Each gate also has a direction, which should be marked on the gate itself and is the direction vehicles must travel across it to count as **crossing the gate**.

A vehicle has crossed a gate when it makes a move action, or multiple move actions, so that the entire vehicle has moved across the line in the correct direction.

Gates in a race type mission will be numbered from 1 upwards, including any start and finish gates.

# Start and Finish Lines

Some gates will be designated as a Start or Finish Line (and sometimes both) and are used to determine the starting and finishing position of a vehicle in a race.

## Final Finishing Positions

At the end of each round in which vehicles cross the Finish Line Gate any vehicle that has crossed the finish line will be removed from the game and ranked according to its finishing position among all vehicles that may have already finished

If more than one vehicle has cross the finish line at the end of a round the vehicles that have crossed the line are ranked by their distance from the finish line, with the higher distances finishing in front.

## Elimination Gates

Some missions will eliminate the last player to cross each gate in a sequence, each gate in turn being designated the **elimination gate**. The first elimination gate is always the second gate at the start of a game.

The first time a round ends where all, or all but one, vehicles have crossed the current elimination gate, one vehicle will be eliminated and removed from the game. If one vehicle has not crossed the elimination gate it is removed from the game, otherwise it is the vehicle that is closest to the elimination gate at the end of that round that is removed.

Once a vehicle has been removed the next gate in the sequence becomes the elimination gate.

In addition, if any vehicle crosses a gate that is 2 gates ahead of the current elimination gate (i.e. a vehicle crosses gate 4 when gate 2 is still the elimination gate) then any vehicle that has not crossed the elimination gate is also removed. This happens immediately, and not at the end of the round.

# Wreckage

Terrain in Wasteland Rally can be given the Wreckage keyword. Vehicles can attempt to smash their way through wreckage instead of driving the long way around.

In addition, any vehicle that is destroyed is not removed from the game but instead placed either on its side or upside down and counts as terrain with the **wreckage** keyword.

# Vehicle Movement and Collisions

Vehicles in Wasteland Rally may move freely over other vehicles bases and terrain with the **Wreckage** keyword, so long as they complete their movement with no bases overlapping. 

If a vehicle moves across another vehicles base then both models must also take a **Defence** test to avoid a collision. Any vehicle that fails this test takes 1 point of damage while any vehicle that rolls a critical success inflicts 1 damage on the other vehicle.

If a vehicle moves across wreckage terrain then only the vehicle rolls a **Defence Test**. If it scores a critical success the wreckage is removed from the battlefield.

# High Speed Evasion

A vehicle which moves its full speed without reducing its movement to take additional manoeuvres gains a speed token and will always count as having evaded an attack until its next activation.

# Boost Marker

Any vehicle that moves within 1 inch of a boost marker must make a free 6 inch move directly forward without making any manoeuvres once it has completed its activation. If it collides with any terrain and must stop it rolls a **Defence Test**, if it fails it takes 3 points of damage.

# Two Lap Race

Teams line up to race around a circuit for two laps with points awarded for finishing positions at the end of the race.

## Terrain

Set up your terrain so that there is a closed loop race track roughly 60-80 inches long. Place a gate to indicate the start/finish gate and a second gate at the furthest point on the track from the first gate.

## Deployment Areas

Starting with the player that won the roll for deployment, each player alternates placing a vehicle as close as possible to the starting gate without placing any part of the vehicle over the gate itself. Vehicles must also be placed at least 2 inches away from other vehicles.

# Arena Race

Teams race from gate to gate scoring points for the first vehicle to cross each line in a maze-like arena.

## Terrain

Set up your terrain so that there are 2 gates facing each other on opposite sides of the board, at least 36 inches away. One gate will be the start/finish gate. The rest of the terrain should be set up to allow multiple ways to cross the board between the gates.

## Deployment Areas

Starting with the player that won the roll for deployment, each player alternates placing a vehicle as close as possible to the starting gate without placing any part of the vehicle over the gate itself. Vehicles must also be placed at least 2 inches away from other vehicles.

# Elimination Race

Teams race around a closed circuit with the last driver to cross each gate in turn eliminated from the race.

## Terrain

Set up your terrain so that there is a closed loop race track at least 60 inches long. Place a gate to indicate the start/finish line and a second gate at the furthest point on the track from the first gate.

## Deployment Areas

Starting with the player that won the roll for deployment, each player alternates placing a vehicle as close as possible to the starting gate without placing any part of the vehicle over the gate itself. Vehicles must also be placed at least 2 inches away from other vehicles.

# Battle Royale

Teams are positioned around a large arena with points awarded for each time an opponent is damaged.

## Terrain

Set up your terrain so that is evenly distributed and vehicles may pass easily between each piece. Set up a number of gates equal to the number of players facing the center of the table, evenly distributed and 16 inches away from the center.

## Deployment 

The player that won the roll for deployment chooses one of the gates as their start line, the other player uses the other gate.

Starting with the player that won the roll for deployment, each player alternates placing a vehicle as close as possible to their starting gate without placing any part of the vehicle over the gate itself. Vehicles must also be placed at least 2 inches away from other vehicles.

# Scavengers

Teams that are falling behind often use the downtime between races to scrounge up some extra scrap to boost their standings, unfortunately the other teams see this as an opportunity to do some extra damage.

## Terrain

Set up terrain so that it is evenly distributed and vehicles may pass easily between each piece. Set up one gate in the middle of any table edge facing off the battlefield.

## Deployment Areas

The team with the lowest number of points will be set up anywhere within 12 inches of the battlefield edge with the gate on it. The other players may set up anywhere within 6 inches of the same battlefield edge and at least 6 inches from the

# Outrun

Winning the Wasteland Rally means nothing if you cant get the goods back to safety, and once your out in the Wasteland theres nothing stopping the other teams simply trying to take what they want.

## Terrain

Set up terrain so that it creates a single track that is at least 60 inches long, with plenty of obstacles along the way. Place one gate at the end of this track so that it is along an edge of the battlefield.
