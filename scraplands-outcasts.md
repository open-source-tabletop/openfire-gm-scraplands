**Section 1 - Setting**
=======================

## Outcasts, Mutants and Miscreants

To the people of the Scraplands their enclave is a thin line between survival and destruction. Strict obedience to the law of the enclave is paramount, with those that do not fit in cast out to survive on their own. Most don't survive more than a few days, those that do join the ranks of the dispossessed, those that could not survive in the enclaves: the violent criminals, deranged madmen that thrive on the chaos, and the disfigured mutants, twisted by the radiation and chemicals that litter the Scraplands.

**Section 2 - Module Rules**
============================

This module is a planned expansion for Scraplands: Bad Blood and will be added soon.
