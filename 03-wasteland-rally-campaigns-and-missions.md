# Ways to Play

## One-Off Game

If players wish to play a single game they should agree on which size of game they want to play and any constraints on the number of vehicles being used. They can then build their team following the rules in the Army Reference to build a team following those constraints. Players should create their teams before deciding, or randomly determining, which mission to play.

Some common game sizes:

- **15 points, 2 vehicles**: This is ideal for a quick game lasting under an hour.
- **30 points, 4-6 vehicles**: A good sized game lasting just over an hour.
- **60 points, 7-10 vehicles**: A large game lasting an hour or more.
- **90 points, 10+ vehicles**: A very large game lasting 2 hours or more.
