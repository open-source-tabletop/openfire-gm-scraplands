# Wasteland Rally

Wasteland Rally is a post apocalyptic vehicle combat Game Module for the Open Fire system. Find out more at https://github.com/open-source-tabletop/openfire/

## The End of the World

The world ended in nuclear war that destroyed nearly everything, but you've heard that story before. The end of the world before is just history, a myth of a time that no one really remembers.

These days people get by in small enclaves, heavily fortified camps, scraping by on the meager resources they scavenge from the endless wasteland.

The wasteland is too vast and too dangerous to scavenge on foot, instead the enclaves assemble vehicles from the plentiful wreckage along the old roads and cities. Teams are sent out to pull together whatever they can find. But there are other ways to acquire a little extra...

## The Racing Arena

It's human nature to see a niche and exploit it. That's how we got here in the first place. Against a backdrop of near endless struggle came the racing arenas, and the Wasteland Rally.

Those same teams that scour the wasteland have the opportunity to turn their pitiful hauls into a bounty that will sustain their enclave for months (at just a little personal risk). Competing against other teams in violent races and arena battles, the eventual winner takes all, minus a small fee to the organizer of course.

# Module Rules

## Gates

Wasteland Rally uses a type of objective marker called a Gate, which is a line roughly 8-10 inches wide (though you can model more interesting terrain for your gates). Each gate also has a direction, which should be marked on the gate itself and is the direction vehicles must travel across it to count as **crossing the gate**.

A vehicle has crossed a gate when it makes a move action, or multiple move actions, so that the entire vehicle has moved across the line in the correct direction.

Gates in a race type mission will be numbered from 1 upwards, including any start and finish gates.

## Start and Finish Lines

Some gates will be designated as a Start or Finish Line (and sometimes both) and are used to determine the starting and finishing position of a vehicle in a race.

### Final Finishing Positions

At the end of each round in which vehicles cross the Finish Line Gate any vehicle that has crossed the finish line will be removed from the game and ranked according to its finishing position among all vehicles that may have already finished

If more than one vehicle has cross the finish line at the end of a round the vehicles that have crossed the line are ranked by their distance from the finish line, with the higher distances finishing in front.

### Elimination Gates

Some missions will eliminate the last player to cross each gate in a sequence, each gate in turn being designated the **elimination gate**. The first elimination gate is always the second gate at the start of a game.

The first time a round ends where all, or all but one, vehicles have crossed the current elimination gate, one vehicle will be eliminated and removed from the game. If one vehicle has not crossed the elimination gate it is removed from the game, otherwise it is the vehicle that is closest to the elimination gate at the end of that round that is removed.

Once a vehicle has been removed the next gate in the sequence becomes the elimination gate.

In addition, if any vehicle crosses a gate that is 2 gates ahead of the current elimination gate (i.e. a vehicle crosses gate 4 when gate 2 is still the elimination gate) then any vehicle that has not crossed the elimination gate is also removed. This happens immediately, and not at the end of the round.

## Wreckage

Terrain in Wasteland Rally can be given the Wreckage keyword. Vehicles can attempt to smash their way through wreckage instead of driving the long way around.

In addition, any vehicle that is destroyed is not removed from the game but instead placed either on its side or upside down and counts as terrain with the **wreckage** keyword.

## Vehicle Movement and Collisions

Vehicles in Wasteland Rally may move freely over other vehicles bases and terrain with the **Wreckage** keyword, so long as they complete their movement with no bases overlapping. 

If a vehicle moves across another vehicles base then both models must also take a **Defence** test to avoid a collision. Any vehicle that fails this test takes 1 point of damage while any vehicle that rolls a critical success inflicts 1 damage on the other vehicle.

If a vehicle moves across wreckage terrain then only the vehicle rolls a **Defence Test**. If it scores a critical success the wreckage is removed from the battlefield.

## High Speed Evasion

A vehicle which moves its full speed without reducing its movement to take additional manoeuvres gains a speed token and will always count as having evaded an attack until its next activation.

## Boost Marker

Any vehicle that moves within 1 inch of a boost marker must make a free 6 inch move directly forward without making any manoeuvres once it has completed its activation. If it collides with any terrain and must stop it rolls a **Defence Test**, if it fails it takes 3 points of damage.
